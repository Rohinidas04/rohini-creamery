Rohini Das(15112 Term Project)
Short Description:
Rohini’s Creamery is an ice cream game that is inspired by the game Papa’s 
Freezeria. In the game, the player acts as an ice cream maker and scooper. 
The player takes multiple customers' randomly generated ice cream orders and 
uses buttons, sliders, and drag and drop features to create the batter, 
scoop icecream into a cone/cup, and add toppings. At the end, 
the user is graded based on accuracy and earns points. 
The goal of the game is for the user to score a designated number of points
in an allotted time. Additional features include individual timers for each customer, varying difficulty based on score, splash screens,
and a grid view.
